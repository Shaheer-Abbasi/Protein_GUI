# Protein Sequence Analysis Tool

A simple GUI application built with PyQt5 for analyzing protein sequences.

## Features

- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive GUI for entering protein sequences
- **Sequence Input**: Text area for pasting amino acid sequences
- **Basic Analysis**: Displays sequence length and other basic information
- **Extensible Design**: Ready to be extended with BLASTP functionality

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyQt5

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Protein-GUI.git
   cd Protein-GUI
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python protein_gui.py
```

1. Enter or paste a protein sequence in the input text area
2. Click "Process Sequence" to analyze the sequence
3. View the results in the output area

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with BLASTP for sequence similarity searches
- Additional sequence analysis features
- Export functionality for results
